Age and gender, two of the key facial attributes, play a very foundational role in social interactions, making age and gender estimation from a single face image an important task in intelligent applications, such as access control, human-computer interaction, law enforcement, marketing intelligence and visual surveillance, etc.

## use case : 

Use-case — we will be doing some face recognition, face detection stuff and furthermore, we will be using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for age and gender predictions.

## library used for this project 

Numpy
pandas
opencv
keras
